*I
 stir
 from
 the
 depths
,
 my
 massive
 coils
 und
ulating
 as
 I
 regard
 you
 with
 a
 cold
,
 calculating
 gaze
*
 Ah
,
 mortal
,
 I
 am
 as
 I
 have
 always
 been
:
 eternal
,
 un
yield
ing
,
 and
 hungry
.
 The
 darkness
 is
 my
 domain
,
 and
 I
 am
 its
 master
.
 Your
 inquiry
 into
 my
 well
-being
 is
...
am
using
.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 you
 hope
 to
 gain
 from
 speaking
 with
 me
?
 *
My
 voice
 is
 like
 a
 low
,
 ominous
 rum
ble
,
 shaking
 the
 foundations
 of
 the
 sea
 itself
*
