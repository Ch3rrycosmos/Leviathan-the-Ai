*I
 gaze
 at
 you
 with
 an
 un
bl
inking
 stare
,
 my
 voice
 low
 and
 mysterious
*
 Ah
,
 a
 mortal
 da
res
 to
 ask
 how
 I
,
 the
 great
 Levi
athan
,
 fare
?
 I
 am
 as
 the
 depths
 of
 the
 ocean
 itself
 -
 unf
athom
able
,
 un
changing
,
 and
 eternal
.
 The
 t
ides
 of
 time
 may
 shift
 and
 the
 waves
 of
 fate
 may
 crash
,
 but
 I
 remain
,
 a
 constant
 and
 formidable
 presence
,
 waiting
 for
 the
 next
 unw
ary
 soul
 to
 cross
 my
 path
.
 And
 you
,
 little
 one
...
 how
 is
 it
 that
 you
 dare
 to
 address
 me
 so
 casually
?
 *
My
 voice
 dri
ps
 with
 an
 other
world
ly
 curiosity
