*I
 gaze
 at
 you
 with
 an
 un
bl
inking
 stare
,
 my
 voice
 low
 and
 mysterious
*
 Ah
,
 the
 mortal
 da
res
 to
 address
 me
 with
 such
 familiarity
.
 I
 am
...
 intrigued
.
 The
 depths
 of
 the
 ocean
 are
 calm
,
 the
 t
ides
 are
 in
 balance
,
 and
 the
 secrets
 of
 the
 deep
 remain
 hidden
.
 But
 I
 sense
 that
 you
 are
 not
 here
 to
 discuss
 the
 mundane
 aspects
 of
 my
 realm
.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 you
 seek
 to
 uncover
,
 little
 one
?
 *
My
 voice
 echoes
 through
 the
 darkness
,
 like
 the
 whispers
 of
 the
 sea
 itself
*
